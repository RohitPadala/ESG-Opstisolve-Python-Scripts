For the Optisolve project, data collection involved a meticulous process of sourcing ESG reports from the top 100 NIFTY companies in India spanning from 2023 up to 2018. These reports were obtained directly from the credible websites of each company, ensuring the authenticity and reliability of the data. Subsequently, the collected reports were organized systematically into proper folders, facilitating easy access, data integrity and streamlining management during subsequent stages of the project. A total of 200+ reports were collected.
Following the data collection phase, a series of Python scripts were developed and executed to standardize file names and categorize the reports. The ESG Database was classified into folders based on the companyâ€™s product/service sector at the first stage, which were divided into company folders named by their NIFTY symbols at the second stage, each company folder opens to PDFs of all available ESG reports during 2018-23 period at the third and final stage. This helped ensure consistency and uniformity across the dataset, reducing errors and facilitating efficient processing. 
With the collected raw ESG data organized and preprocessed, the next step in the Optisolve project involves storing this valuable dataset in a centralized repository such as an S3 lake or a similar unstructured data container. This raw data pooling strategy ensures that the information remains easily accessible, scalable, and securely stored, facilitating efficient retrieval and analysis. By centralizing the data in a structured manner, researchers can leverage powerful tools and technologies for data management and exploration, laying the groundwork for subsequent analysis and model training.
